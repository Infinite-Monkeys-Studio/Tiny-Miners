##Dev's notes##

I really enjoy sandbox building games and programming. What a more perfect way for them to come together.
I expect this game to be hard for me to complete hopefully imposable.
Using processing was a no-brainer a game like this has very little graphics demands and so why not make that the easiest part to write?
Processing has a very simple way to load, display and animate 2D characters.
