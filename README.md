###Quinn's thoughts/notes:###
I really enjoy sandbox building games and programing. What a more perfect way for them to come together.
I excpect this game to be hard for me to complete hopefully imposable for me.
Using processing was a no brainer a game like this has very little graphics demands and so why not make that the easiest part to write?
Processing has a very simple way to load, display and animate 2D charictars.
